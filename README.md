# Random Quote Machine
## freeCodeCamp Front End Library Project #1

The objective is to create a web page that shows random quote each time it loads, with functionality to get a new quote and share the quote to Twitter. Here are the user stories that needs to be fulfilled to pass the test: 

- [X] Wrapper element with corresponding `id="quote-box"`.
- [X] Within `#quote-box`, an element with a corresponding `id="text"`.
- [X] Within `#quote-box`, an element with a corresponding `id="author"`.
- [X] Within `#quote-box`, a clickable element with a corresponding `id="new-quote"`.
- [X] Within `#quote-box`, a clickable element with a corresponding `id="tweet-quote"`.
- [ ] On first load, quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`. 
- [ ] On first load, quote machine displays a random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`.
- [ ] When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, the quote machine fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
- [ ] When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, the new quote's author is fetched and displayed in the `#author` element.
- [ ] Can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` button. The link `"twitter.com/intent/tweet"` is added to `a href=""` to tweet the current quote.
- [ ] The `#quote-box` wrapper element should be horizontally centered (100% zoom and page maximized during testing.)
